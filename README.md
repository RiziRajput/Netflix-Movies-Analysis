# Netflix Movie Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix movies and TV shows using available datasets. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about the movies' ratings, genres, release years, and other key factors to help make data-driven decisions. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to identify trends and predict outcomes.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw data by handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting categorical variables.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between different variables such as movie genres, ratings, and release years.
* **Machine Learning Models**: Implement models for predicting ratings, movie success, or genre classification.
* **Visualization**: Beautifully designed graphs and charts for better data interpretation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including:

* **Title**: Name of the movie or show
* **Genres**: Categories like Drama, Comedy, Action, etc.
* **Release Year**: The year the movie or show was released
* **IMDb Ratings**: Rating of the movie on IMDb
* **Duration**: Length of the movie or show
* **Language**: Language in which the movie/show is available
* **Country**: The country where the movie/show was produced

The dataset can be found in the repository under the `data` folder.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiziRajput/netflix-movie-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` folder.

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.

2. Load the data from the `data` folder and start your analysis.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('data/netflix_data.csv')
   ```

3. Run the analysis and explore various visualizations:

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   # Sample Plot
   sns.barplot(x='genres', y='ratings', data=df)
   plt.show()
   ```

## Key Insights

* The most popular genres on Netflix
* The relationship between movie release year and rating
* A prediction model for the rating of upcoming movies

## Future Improvements

* Add more features like user reviews and box-office data for more comprehensive analysis.
* Implement sentiment analysis on movie descriptions.
* Enhance predictive models by using advanced machine learning techniques.
